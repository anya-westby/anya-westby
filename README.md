👋 Hey, I’m Anya

I’m a Frontend Engineer & UX Designer who loves building fast, intuitive web and mobile experiences. I’ve worked across React, Next.js, and React Native, blending design systems with clean, scalable code.

💡 I’m currently leading tech at TALA, where I built a virtual concierge platform used by 100+ residents.
🧠 Previously at Robotic Imaging, I developed real-time field tools in React Native and GCP.
🎨 With a background in Computer Science + Creative Technology, I bridge design and engineering to make digital products feel effortless.
